# üö® CRITICAL STORAGE BUCKET ISSUES DETECTED

## Major Problems Found:

### 1. **BUCKET NAME MISMATCHES** ‚ùå

**Storage Setup SQL defines:**
- `profile-images` (with hyphen)
- `chat-attachments` (with hyphen)
- `delivery-notes` (with hyphen)

**But code uses:**
- ‚ùå `admin-profile-images` (doesn't exist in SQL)
- ‚ùå `chat_images` (doesn't exist in SQL) 
- ‚ùå `profile_images` (with underscore instead of hyphen)
- ‚úÖ `delivery-notes` (correct)

### 2. **MISSING BUCKETS** ‚ùå
The following buckets are referenced in code but NOT created in storage setup:
- `admin-profile-images` - Used by admin registration screens
- `chat_images` - Used by chat service

### 3. **INCONSISTENT NAMING** ‚ùå
- Storage setup uses kebab-case (hyphens): `profile-images`
- Some code uses snake_case (underscores): `profile_images`
- Some code uses non-existent buckets: `admin-profile-images`

## IMPACT:
- ‚ùå Admin profile image uploads WILL FAIL
- ‚ùå Chat image uploads WILL FAIL  
- ‚ùå Regular profile image uploads WILL FAIL
- ‚ùå Users will get "Bucket not found" errors
- ‚ùå File upload features are completely broken

## FILES WITH ISSUES:
1. `lib/screens/admin/admin_register_page.dart` - Uses `admin-profile-images`
2. `lib/screens/admin/other_admin_register_page.dart` - Uses `admin-profile-images`  
3. `lib/services/chat_service.dart` - Uses `chat_images`
4. `lib/screens/home/profile_screen.dart` - Uses `profile_images`

## SOLUTION REQUIRED:
Either:
A) Update storage SQL to create missing buckets, OR
B) Update code to use existing bucket names consistently

Recommended: Option B (use existing bucket structure) for consistency.
