# ✅ ALL STORAGE AND DATABASE ISSUES RESOLVED

## 🔍 Issues Detected and Fixed

### 1. **Storage Bucket Name Mismatches** ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: Code referenced incorrect storage bucket names causing "bucket not found" errors
**Files Fixed**:
- `lib/screens/admin/admin_register_page.dart` - Changed 'admin-profile-images' → 'profile-images'
- `lib/screens/admin/other_admin_register_page.dart` - Changed 'admin-profile-images' → 'profile-images'  
- `lib/services/chat_service.dart` - Changed 'chat_images' → 'chat-attachments'
- `lib/screens/home/profile_screen.dart` - Changed 'admin-profile-images' → 'profile-images'

### 2. **Missing Database Components** ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: Missing fuel card locker functionality and RPC functions
**Added to `supabase_database_schema.sql`**:
- `fuel_card_lockers` table with proper foreign keys and RLS policies
- `locker_id` column to `fuel_cards` table
- `receipt_url` column to `fuel_transactions` table  
- `document_url` column to `consignments` table
- `add_fuel_card_to_locker()` RPC function with validation
- `remove_fuel_card_from_locker()` RPC function with validation

### 3. **Model Updates for New Fields** ✅ COMPLETED
**Updated Models**:
- `FuelTransaction` model: Added `receiptUrl` field with proper JSON serialization
- `ConsignmentModel`: Added `documentUrl` field with proper JSON serialization

### 4. **New File Upload Services** ✅ CREATED
**Created Services**:
- `lib/services/fuel_receipt_service.dart` - Complete fuel receipt upload functionality
- `lib/services/consignment_document_service.dart` - Complete consignment document upload functionality

## 📋 Summary of All Fixes

### Database Schema Enhancements:
```sql
-- Added fuel card locker system
CREATE TABLE fuel_card_lockers (...)
ALTER TABLE fuel_cards ADD COLUMN locker_id UUID REFERENCES fuel_card_lockers(id);
ALTER TABLE fuel_transactions ADD COLUMN receipt_url TEXT;
ALTER TABLE consignments ADD COLUMN document_url TEXT;

-- Added RPC functions
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION add_fuel_card_to_locker(...)
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION remove_fuel_card_from_locker(...)
```
