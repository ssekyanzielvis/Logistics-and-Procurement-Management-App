# ✅ SQL Database Schema Issues Fixed

## 🔧 Issues Found and Resolved:

### 1. **Table Creation Order Issue** ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: `fuel_cards` table was referencing `fuel_card_lockers` table before it was created
**Solution**: 
- Moved `fuel_card_lockers` table creation before `fuel_cards` table
- Removed duplicate `fuel_card_lockers` table definition

### 2. **Row Level Security Order** ✅ FIXED  
**Problem**: RLS policies were defined in wrong order
**Solution**: 
- Reordered RLS enable statements to match table creation order
- Moved fuel card locker policies to proper location
- Removed duplicate policy definitions

## 📋 Corrected Table Creation Order:

1. ✅ `users` (base table)
2. ✅ `admins` (references users)
3. ✅ `consignments` (references users)
4. ✅ `delivery_notes` (references users & consignments)
5. ✅ `fuel_card_lockers` **← MOVED FIRST**
6. ✅ `fuel_cards` (references users & fuel_card_lockers)
7. ✅ `fuel_card_assignments` (references fuel_cards & users)
8. ✅ `fuel_transactions` (references fuel_cards & users)
9. ✅ `chat_rooms` (references users)
10. ✅ `chat_room_participants` (references chat_rooms & users)
11. ✅ `chat_messages` (references chat_rooms & users)

## 🛡️ RLS Policies Correctly Ordered:

- ✅ All tables have RLS enabled in proper order
- ✅ Fuel card locker policies moved to correct location
- ✅ No duplicate policy definitions
- ✅ All foreign key references resolved before use

## 🎯 SQL Execution Status:
